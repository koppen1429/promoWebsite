    <p>I participate in National Honor Society, <a href="https://troop297.trooptrack.com/">Boy Scouts</a>, Golf, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Bowl">Science Bowl</a>. I have been patrol leader for 18 months as a Boy Scout, <br> and am currently a Life Scout. I also participated in around 80 hours of community service thus far.</p>

    <p>My miscellaneous interests include fantasy football and video games. I do not spend much time in person with friends outside of school, <br> but that is an extension of my introverted nature.</p>
